# Sign-Language-Classifier
This project was made for Google Bangkit's last project assignment
The current model is named by ASL classifier V3.ipynb

## Dataset
the dataset used to train this model is sourced from Kaggle's [ASL Alphabet dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) where it consist a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.


## Purpose
the purpose of this machine learning model is to classify picture of sign language into 26 alphabet

## Implementation
hypothetically, we can use this model to build a ASL learning game with live interaction where user will get instruction to guess the right hand gesture for a specific letter, than give the result in a matter of second
